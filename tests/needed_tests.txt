Various error conditions for replays should be tested
No replay being saved involves one of player one's minions attacking or being attacked
All replays always draw the card on top of the deck
No replay with a minion with a battlecry is being tested
No replay involving a mage or priest's hero power is being tested
NO non targetted spells are being used in any replay
No options are being saved in any replay
Need much better observer test (and a much better observer)
Wild growth should be used at 10 mana to get the excess mana card
Once Sap or Frozen trap is a card, any spell cards which summon minions should be tested
Nourish should be tested at 10 mana with the choosing mana option
StackedDeck is never run to Fatigue
PredictableAgent is never asked to choose an option
