interesting things:

random effect:
random deck creation is very very implementation sensitive.
tiny changes make big differance on how decks look. for example:
do you first select hero?
what is the number of neatral cards in a deck? should all decks have tha same number??
after two same cards are already inserted do you forbid this card? (increasing other's probability)
