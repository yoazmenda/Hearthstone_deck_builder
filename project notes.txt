interesting things:

random effect:
random deck creation is very very implementation sensitive.
tiny changes make big difference on how decks look. for example:
do you first select hero?
what is the number of neutral cards in a deck? should all decks have tha same number??
after two same cards are already inserted do you forbid this card? (increasing other's probability)

mana curve as a domain specific fitness measure

there is no draw only two sided lose

there are different agents, we can use one, or a few combined

having hardd time implementing roulette wheel because there is no way to select individuals according to a given distribution
only way to do it is binary search that takes o(n(logn)) time

decks change during games. like humans change in their lifetimes and gain features that can't be passed to siblings.
so we return the ORIGINAL deck even if it has changed during the fight ("during it's life") this has a name we learned in class
