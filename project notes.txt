random effect:
random deck creation is very very implementation sensitive.
tiny changes make big difference on how decks look. for example:

what is the number of neutral cards in a deck? should all decks have tha same number??
after two same cards are already inserted do you forbid this card? (increasing other's probability)

having hardd time implementing roulette wheel because there is no way to select individuals according to a given distribution
only way to do it is binary search that takes o(n(logn)) time
