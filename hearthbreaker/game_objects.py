class Bindable:
    """
    A class which inherits from Bindable has an event structure added to it.

    This event structure follows the observer pattern.  It consists of two parts: binding and triggering.
    A function handler is bound to an event using the :meth:`bind` or :meth:`bind_once` methods.  When the event is
    triggered using the :meth:`trigger` method, then any function handlers which have been bound to that event are
    called.

    Arguments can be passed to a bound function when binding or when triggering, or both.  Arguments from triggering
    are passed first, followed by arguments from binding.

    Functions can be bound such that they are called each time an event is triggered, or so that they are only called
    the next time a function is triggered.  The former case is handled by :meth:`bind` and the latter by
    :meth:`bind_once`

    **Examples**:

    Simple Binding::

       class EventTarget(Bindable):
           def __init__(self):
               super().__init__()

       def handler(fangs, scales):
           print("fangs: {:d}, scales: {:d}".format(fangs, scales))

       target = EventTarget()
       target.bind("attack", handler, 1001)
       target.trigger("attack", 2)             # outputs "fangs: 2, scales: 1001"
       target.trigger("attack", 6)             # outputs "fangs: 6, scales: 1001"

    Binding Once::

       class EventTarget(Bindable):
           def __init__(self):
               super().__init__()

       def handler(joke):
            print("{:s}! HAHAHA".format(joke))

       target = EventTarget()
       target.bind_once("joke_told", handler)

       # outputs "Well, I'd better replace it then! HAHAHA"
       target.trigger("joke_told", "Well, I'd better replace it then")

       # outputs nothing
       target.trigger("joke_told", "What a senseless waste of human life")
