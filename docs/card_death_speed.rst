Card Death Speed
================

The following table lists all cards in hearthstone, sorted by how long a deck consisting solely of this card will take to end the game.  These tests assume the player will play the card optimally (i.e. may not play it on the first turn).  They were re-run 30 times, and the lowest one taken for cards with random effects (e.g. Mad Bomber).

In almost every case (except Hellfire and Pit Lord), this means the enemy hero is dead.
