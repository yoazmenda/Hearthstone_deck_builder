Hearthbreaker Documentation
===========================

The purpose of this project is to create an open source Hearthstone simulator for the purposes of machine learning and
data mining of Blizzard's .  The end goal
is to create a system implementing every card in Hearthstone, then simulate games of bots against bots to train
them.  The results from these games can be used to determine cards which work well together and cards which do not, and
possibly discover new deck types.
The goal is not to create a clone of Hearthstone which players can use to replace the game itself with.

All cards prior to Goblins vs Gnomes have been implemented.  GvG cards are in the process of being implemented
